Experiments with Javascript and [d3](https://d3js.org/)

## How to run the examples

The simplest examples can just be opened as local files in a browser on your local machine.

The ones depending on d3 however, cannot be run locally (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21030503/)

Instead, the simplest way to run the examples is to navigate to the folder containing the examples and then run:

```
python -m http.server 8888 &
```

Then in your local machine's browser, navigate to `localhost:8888` and click on the HTML file from there.
